# iTop-List-Tab-OS
Just adds a 'Used by' tab in OS and OS Family

This extension does nearly nothing : it just adds the 'Useb by' tab in the OS Version and OS Family view.

Very practical when it's time to do some cleaning up :)

Also, just for a better visual alignent, add icons to these two classes.
